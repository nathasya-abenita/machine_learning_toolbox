This is a project from an undergraduate machine learning class by Mathematics ITB. Three machine learning tools have been developed:
1. Linear regression with n-order polynom
2. K-Nearest neighbor classification
3. Clustering with bisecting K-means
The tools have been integrated to an app with Streamlit.
